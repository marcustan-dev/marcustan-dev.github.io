			I'm a person who <strong>love challenges</strong> and always see the <strong>opportunities</strong> in setbacks. Although I've dabbled in different industry — from health nutrition, sales closing to online shopping e-commerce, I'm currently advancing my education in taking up an advance degree in Modern Programming and a self-taught developer.

      I’ve always sought out <strong>opportunities</strong> and <strong>challenges</strong> that are <strong>meaningful</strong> to me. Although my professional path has taken many twists and turns — from being a nutritionist, giving public health talks, grooming key potential vendors for online shopping sites B2C platform, conducting sales personality trainings & coaching sessions, to now picking up (or trying very hard) advance degree in Modern Technology  — I've never stopped engaging my passion to help others and solve problems.

      Although the following may sound like a typical stucked up elaboration & praises on how good I am and how I would/can/have/could benefit the company etc etc...BUT honest to God I really mean it. Mean it that – I enjoy using my obsessive attention to details, my unequivocal <strong>love</strong> for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to literally change the world. That's why I’m excited to make a <strong>big impact</strong> at a high growth company.

       For now I am only self-taught developer, I started to learn coding while transitioning to a new career pathway in tech while seeking opportunities to further grow my passion into a stable, sustainable & high success career. I love challenges, new projects, and solving problems.
